## 🔌 API Configuration

This project uses the **ExchangeRate API** for real-time currency conversion.

**Current Endpoint**:
```
https://v6.exchangerate-api.com/v6/{API_KEY}/latest/{CURRENCY_CODE}
```

To use your own API key:
1. Sign up at [exchangerate-api.com](https://www.exchangerate-api.com)
2. Replace the API key in `app.js` (line with the fetch URL) with your own

## 💻 How It Works
